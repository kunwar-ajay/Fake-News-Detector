📰 Fake News Detection System

Machine Learning | Python | Scikit-learn | NLTK | TF-IDF

This project is a complete Fake News Classification System built using machine learning.
It detects whether a given news article is Real or Fake using classical ML models such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest trained on the ISOT Fake News Dataset.

✔️ TF-IDF Vectorization (Uni-grams & Bi-grams)

✔️ Logistic Regression & Random Forest trained models

✔️ Achieved ~92% accuracy

✔️ Clean NLP pipeline: stopwords removal, lemmatization, noise reduction

✔️ Prediction function for real-time classification

✔️ Model + Vectorizer saved via Pickle

✔️ Google Colab friendly
